# StarWars
Text analysis of the Star Wars original trilogy film scripts.

Script cleaning and Word2Vec analysis was done via Python, and visualizations and dashboard creation were created in R.

The dashboard created via R's flexdashboard and shiny libraries can be found here: https://jakehogan.shinyapps.io/Dashboard2/
